# All About NumPy
Let’s start learning NumPy — one of the most powerful libraries in Python for numerical and scientific computing.

# Learn NumPy in Python

This project is a step-by-step guide to learning NumPy for numerical and scientific computing in Python.

## Setup Instructions

###  1. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
# requirements.txt
numpy
jupyterlab
```

### Launch JupyterLab or Notebook

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

### Quick Start
Create a new .ipynb notebook and start exploring:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a + 10)  # Broadcasting example

```

 
* Let me know if you'd like the actual `requirements.txt` as a separate file too or want to add sections like version pinning (`numpy==1.26.4`, etc.).
